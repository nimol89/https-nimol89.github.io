  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Project Goals</h2>
  <p>This project explores the interconnectedness of education, economic growth, and environmental management as key pillars for promoting sustainable development in Cambodia. While rapid economic expansion has fueled improvements in living standards, it has also led to environmental degradation and socio-economic disparities. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic strategy that integrates educational reform, sustainable economic policies, and robust environmental governance. By enhancing environmental education, empowering local communities, and fostering a green economy, this approach seeks to cultivate an informed populace that actively participates in sustainable practices. Through a comprehensive review of current policies and developmental strategies, we propose a multi-sectoral framework that aligns national educational initiatives with environmental and economic goals. This paper argues that investing in education and adopting sustainable practices are critical to balancing economic growth with ecological conservation, ensuring a resilient and sustainable future for Cambodia.

 <h2>Paper 2: Renewable Energy in Cambodia: Challenges, Opportunities and Relations Recommendations</h2>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The emerging challenge of Cambodia lies critically in the uneven expanse of electricity consumption versus the income of the people in the local community as the country is known to have the highest price of electricity in ASEAN. Given the potential of being the chairman of ASEAN in 2022, another point of discussion arises upon the progress of renewable energy development in the country, which is significant to boost income growth and bring about modernization 4.0.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Challenges in Renewable Energy Development</h2>
    <p>The rising challenges lie critically on the feasibility of the progress toward renewable energy development despite the lack of techniques and resources. The purpose of this paper aims at investigating the potential area for developing renewable energy and approaches toward its utilization through the study of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Existing types of energy in specific locations and the given potential.</li>
        <li>Current challenges and future concerns.</li>
        <li>Possibility of international energy cooperation between countries.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Opportunities for Renewable Energy Development</h2>
    <p>Even though many global powers are leading in terms of renewable energy development, cooperation with Cambodia on that particular area is feasible only with a similar context of policies, technical suitability, and political willingness to cooperate and shared partnerships.</p>
    <p>Therefore, critical analysis of the current challenges and existing potential are essential in the analysis of international cooperation for developing countries as well as Cambodia.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The conclusion of the paper would further elaborate on the possibility of cooperation with relevant countries that could efficiently foster growth in the respective areas based on suitability and utilization of resources and partnerships.</p>
